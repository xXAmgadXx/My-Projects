Assignment 2 [10 marks]
Deadline: 28 Dec 2022

* This assignment can be done in teams of 5 students or less.
* Team members must be from the same lab so the TA can discuss all of them during one lab time.
* Each team must come up with their own implementation.
* Each student in the team must understand all details of the implementation.
* The code must contain no more than 15,000 characters.
* Your code must NOT include any TAB character. Convert each TAB to 4 spaces before submitting.
* You are not allowed to copy any piece of code from the internet or from any other resource.
* You are not allowed to copy any piece of code from other students.
* You are not allowed to include any files or built-in libraries, except for the described ones.
* Half the mark is dedicated to comments explaining the code.
* If you have issue regarding the assignment, contact the TA, not the doctor.
* Get your submission on a flash drive and discuss your submission with the TA during the first lab after the deadline.
* The TA will not tell you your mark. He will report his evaluation to me and I will make the final evaluation.
* You are allowed to submit after the deadline with 10% mark-deduction for each late day.

* Write a 32-bits intel-syntax assembly program that can be compiled in the same way the 32-bits lab samples are compiled.
The program should take the following inputs from the user:
* An integer n.
* n floating point numbers (Use the "double" type. Do not use "float" type.)
The program should output ((n) + 1/1) * ((n-1) + 1/2) * ((n-2) + 1/3) * ((n-3) + 1/4) * ... * (2 + 1/(n-1)) * (1 + 1/(n)).
Example:
The user inputs: 3
The program outputs: sum=13.333

To submit the code:
* Write your code in exactly one text file such as myfile.s.
* Make sure that myfile.s contains the actual code, for example open it in Notepad.
* Encode the file using the assign_encoder tool as the following:
g++ -O3 -o assign_encoder.exe assign_encoder.cpp
assign_encoder.exe ./myfile.s 2 3 20101111 20102222 20113333
* The 2 in the above line is the assignment ID. The 3 in the above line is number of students.
* Open the resulting assign_2_20101111_20102222_20113333.bin file in a text editor.
* Make sure that the text-editor did not put any line-breaks (un-check the word-wrap option).
* Copy all the text included in the file.
* Submit the text via the following Google link, as well as your IDs. If the number of students is less than 5, put the number 00000000 in place of un-needed IDs.
